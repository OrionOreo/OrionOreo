- I’m looking to collaborate on multiple projects!

- Ask me about python stuff, I'm ALOT better at python than other langs
- How to reach me: azzynchara@gmail.com or azzynchara@outlook.com
- Pronouns: Any and all
- Fun fact: I started programming at the age of like... 7 or 8, simply to automate my computer and to auto kill random tasks that start on start up.
