## Hello There. <!-- General Kenobe -->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I’m currently working on WingOS (C++ more than python) and just random stuff
- I’m currently learning C++, C and more low level langs like ASM
- I’m looking to collaborate on WingOS. I'm no where near a pro dev, and yet I choose to make an OS.
- I’m looking for help with ^^^ AS ABOVE. ^^^
- Ask me about python stuff, I'm ALOT better at python than other langs
- How to reach me: azzynchara@gmail.com or azzynchara@outlook.com
- Pronouns: Any and all
- Fun fact: I started programming at the age of like... 7 or 8, simply to automate my computer and to auto kill random tasks that start on start up.
